User management : requirements

In Java or Python, implement a REST API that models users and associated permissions.
A user should have at least the following attributes:
    family name
    given name
    birthdate
    email

A user's permission should have at least the following attributes:
    type
    granted date

The API should provide the endpoints to satisfy at least the following functional requirements:
    list users
    add user
    remove user
    get user by id
    grant permission for a user
    revoke permission for a user
    search users by family name

The choice of frameworks and data stores are at your discretion. Please keep in mind that the purpose is not solely to provide a working solution. We are looking for candidates to demonstrate the principles and practices he/she feels are important in software engineering: dependency management, testing, project structure, data modelling, etc. A time commitment of around 4-5 hours for this should be sufficient (we hope, open to feedback of course) to check all the boxes.
